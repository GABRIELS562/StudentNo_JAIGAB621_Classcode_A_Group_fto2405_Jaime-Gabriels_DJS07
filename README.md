# DJS07 - Build a Meme Generator

In this challenge you are required to code-along the Scrimba lesson: https://scrimba.com/playlist/prXJpCQ

This starter repo only has CSS styling added to the empty React project.

After cloning run `npm install` to install dependencies.

create react app

-check or install node js

	•	create-react-app is a package that generates the base structure for a new React project.
    npm start in terminal

    The npm install command is used to install all the dependencies and packages defined in the package.json file.

    When you create a React application using create-react-app, it generates several files and folders by default. Here’s a review of the main ones:

	1.	public/ Directory:
	•	Contains static assets like the index.html file and favicon.
	•	The index.html file is the single HTML page into which your React app will be rendered. The root DOM element (typically 
        <div id="root"></div>)  is where React injects the components.
	2.	src/ Directory:
	•	This is where your React application code lives.
	•	Key files:
	•	index.js: The entry point of the React application. It renders the root component (<App />) into the DOM.
	•	App.js: The main component, which can be customized to hold your app’s UI and logic.
	•	App.css: Default styling for the App.js component.
	•	index.css: Global CSS styles for the application.
	3.	package.json:
	•	The configuration file for your project, which defines dependencies, scripts, and project metadata.
	•	Key sections:
	•	dependencies: Lists packages that are required to run the app (e.g., react, react-dom).
	•	scripts: Contains commands for common tasks (e.g., npm start, npm build).
	4.	node_modules/:
	•	Contains all the installed npm packages required by your project.
	5.	.gitignore:
	•	A file that lists files and directories Git should ignore (e.g., node_modules/, build artifacts, etc.).
	6.	README.md:
	•	Provides documentation about the project, including instructions for setup, running the app, and more.
Discuss the importance of structuring your application in a way that is easy to understand and maintain.
Readability, scalability, Reusable, Easier to maintain 


Explain how to break down the UI into reusable components.




Review how to pass data between components using props.
